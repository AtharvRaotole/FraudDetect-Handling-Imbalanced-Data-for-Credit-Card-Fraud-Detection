# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to detect credit card fraud using machine learning techniques. The project aims to build a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions.

## Introduction

Credit card fraud is a significant issue that affects both individuals and financial institutions. This project leverages machine learning to detect fraudulent transactions, aiming to minimize the financial losses caused by such activities.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the [Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud) available on Kaggle. It contains transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013, with 284,807 transactions and 492 fraudulent transactions.

## Installation

To run the notebook, you need to have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed. You can install the necessary packages using the following commands: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn



## Methodology

The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Data Exploration and Preprocessing**: Load and explore the dataset, handle missing values, scale features, and split the data into training and testing sets.
2. **Model Selection**: Train different machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting.
3. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and choose the best model for detecting credit card fraud.

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated based on its ability to correctly identify fraudulent transactions. The best-performing model is highlighted, and its metrics are presented in the notebook.
